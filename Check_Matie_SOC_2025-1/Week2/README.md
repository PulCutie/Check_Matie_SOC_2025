This week, you will work on two tasks involving game-playing bots:

## Task 1: Tic-Tac-Toe Bot

You will create a bot to play Tic-Tac-Toe using **alpha-beta pruning**.  
- Complete the implementation in `q1.py`.  
- Test your bot using `play_tictactoe.py`.

## Task 2: Notakto Bot

Notakto is a variant of Tic-Tac-Toe played on multiple boards with only **'X'** as a symbol.  
- You will again use **alpha-beta pruning**.  
- Complete the implementation in `q2.py`.

## Notes

- Both template files (`q1.py` and `q2.py`) are provided.  
- Make sure to read `problem_statement.pdf` thoroughly to understand the tasks.
